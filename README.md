# The VBA of Wall Street (Completed)

The code can work for all three sheets, but it does not calcuate for all sheets with one script. The headers were added manually, and while I wasn't sure if it was needed to use VBA to calculate the values, I simply used Excel formulas to find the values and have it print that way. - Mark
